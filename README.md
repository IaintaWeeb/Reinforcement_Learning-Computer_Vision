# Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision
Hi! This is a self-project that I have taken to explore the domains of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Computer Vision**.

## Outline of the Project:
1. I first learn about Reinforcement Learning by following **Sutton-Bartol** for theory and Previous year assignments of **CS-747** for practice.
2. In the second part I explore Computer Vision by taking up a course on **Coursera** as well as completing the assignments. 

## Reinforcement Learning
### Week 1
In this week, I learned about Markov decision processes. After gaining a theoretical idea, I completed the coding assignment which was to code up the MDP in Python. 

### Week 2
In this week, I learned about the N-arm Bandit and solving Markov decision processes. This week's assignment was to employ **Value Iteration**, **Policy Iteration**, and **Linear Programming** to solve a Maze. There are two parts here: first encoding a maze as a MDP and then solving the MDP.

### Week 3
This week we delved into RL Algorithms like Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, and Q-Learning. We employed this to solve normal and king move version of the Classic Windy Gridworld Problem.
